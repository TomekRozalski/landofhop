# Land of Hop

React SPA application with beer catalogue. Just front-end. I keep back-end on [an another repository](https://github.com/tomekrozalski/landofhop-back), mostly because I would like to connect with the API also from another endpoints (Svelte, Gatsby etc.) I use my favourites libraries, like Styled Components, Formik, Immer, Date-fns, React Window. I also try new stuff, like WebGL animations (Pixi) or big dashboard forms hidden under authorization (JWT). It is under continuous, never ending development :)
