# Land of Hop

The 8th version of the beer catalogue application. This time without TypeScript, I am not fully satisfied how it worked in version 7th. Now, I want to try JSDoc. I also want to go back to ESLint with Airbnb styleguide. I will keep work with Styled Components, Formik etc. I will give more attention to React Hooks, removal of unnecessary re-renders, better files structure. I still love to test in Jest and React Testing Library, but first I would like to play with WebGL (PixiJS), animations (Spring) and probably Gatsby.
